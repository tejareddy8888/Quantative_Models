1) dividend yield talks about price changes directly as this can be taken as inverse price to dividend ratio
2) stock-bond correlation 
   1) Bond and equity prices reflect the discounted value of their future cash flows, where the discount rate approximately equals the sum of a:

    2) Inflation rate - compensation for the loss of purchasing power over time 
    3) Risk premium – compensation for the uncertainty of receiving future cash flows
